# AI Honeypot System

Autonomous AI system that detects scam messages and actively engages scammers to extract critical information like bank account details, UPI IDs, and phishing links.
## Features

- 🔍 **Hybrid Scam Detection**: Keyword-based + AI-powered detection with Gemini 2.0 Flash
- 🤖 **AI Agent**: Believable human-like persona that engages scammers
- 📊 **Data Extraction**: Automatic extraction using regex + AI (bank accounts, UPI IDs, phishing links, phone numbers)
- 🔒 **Secure Authentication**: API key authentication with SHA-256 hashing (stored outside database)
- 💾 **Optimized Database**: Batch writes for performance, SQLite with conversation history
- 🚦 **Rate Limiting**: Built-in Gemini API rate limiting (75% of free tier limits)
- 🛡️ **Security Guardrails**: Prevents prompt injection, jailbreaking, and AI disclosure
- 📞 **Callback System**: Sends extracted intelligence when scam is confirmed

**This project was built with AI assisted development tools and manually reviewed, tested and structured by the team. This project is intended as a hackathon prototype and should be reviewed, secured, and tested further before any production use.**

## API Usage

### Message Endpoint (Only Public Endpoint)

**POST /message**

Send a message to the honeypot system. This is the only endpoint exposed for message processing.

**Headers:**
```
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body (example here given for testing purposes):**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "unique-session-id",
  "message": {
    "sender": "scammer",
    "text": "Your account will be blocked. Verify immediately at bit.ly/scam123",
    "timestamp": 1738582028731
  },
  "conversationHistory": [
    {
      "sender": "scammer",
      "text": "Previous message",
      "timestamp": 1738582000000
    },
    {
      "sender": "user",
      "text": "AI's previous response",
      "timestamp": 1738582001000
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "channel": "SMS",
    "language": "English",
    "locale": "IN"
  }
}
```

**Response (example response which you should get):**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "reply": "oh no why is it blocked? i didnt do anything wrong. what link should i click?"
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Authentication**: API key verified from `X-API-Key` header.
2. **Scam Detection**: 
   - First, keyword-based detection (fast)
   - If keywords match, AI detection is invoked
   - Hybrid confidence score calculated using keywords and AI based detection.
3. **Data Extraction**:
   - Regex patterns extract UPI IDs, bank accounts, URLs, phone numbers
   - AI extraction runs in parallel for obfuscated data
   - Results merged and deduplicated
4. **AI Response Generation**:
   - Rate limiting checked (75% of Gemini free tier)
   - Context-aware response with human-like persona
   - Guardrails prevent AI disclosure and prompt injection
5. **Callback Trigger**:
   - Sent when: scam confirmed, confidence ≥ 60%, ≥3 exchanges, data extracted
   - Payload includes all extracted intelligence

### Callback Format

When scam is confirmed and intelligence is extracted, a callback like this is sent to `CALLBACK_URL`:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc123-session-id",
  "scamDetected": true,
  "totalMessagesExchanged": 18,
  "extractedIntelligence": {
    "bankAccounts": ["1234567890123"],
    "upiIds": ["scammer@paytm"],
    "phishingLinks": ["http://bit.ly/scam123"],
    "phoneNumbers": ["+911234567890"],
    "suspiciousKeywords": ["urgent", "verify", "account blocked", "click link"]
  },
  "agentNotes": "Engagement completed after 18 messages. Scam intelligence extracted."
}
```
### Set your own environment variables according to the the example environment file in the repository. A working render.yaml file has also been provided for auto deployment to Render as a web service.
